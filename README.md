# ImageCaptionGenerator
This project builds an image caption generator using deep learning. It extracts visual features via CNN and textual context using LSTM to generate descriptive captions for images. The model is trained on a dataset with multiple captions per image and evaluated using BLEU scores to measure language accuracy.
